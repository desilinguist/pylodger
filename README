While Anaconda from Continuum Analytics offers a great Python distribution
it lacks the sources to rebuild everything from scratch.

Therefore this repository provides free Conda recipes for all base packages and
some more.

Currently there is no documentation. So only experienced developers
might use the scripts and adapt them for their needs.

Some recipes might not work properly at the time of writing. 

The only platform supported right now is Linux-64.
The packages were built using Centos inside a docker container.



Discovered bugs:

pyyaml tries to parse versions as floats, so 1.1 is the same version
number as 1.10
